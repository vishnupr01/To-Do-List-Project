# To-Do List App

## Project Overview
A simple to-do list app where users can add, remove, edit, and manage their tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's **localStorage** so that they persist even after a page refresh. The app also allows users to filter tasks and organize them by "Due" and "Upcoming".

## Features:
- Add tasks with a description, date, and time.
- Remove tasks.
- Edit tasks.
- Filter tasks based on search input.
- Tasks persist in localStorage even after the page is refreshed.
- Separate "Due" and "Upcoming" tasks based on the current date.
- Styling with Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality (task management, localStorage, filtering, etc.).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For quick and responsive styling (optional).

## How to Use:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Use the input fields to add new tasks.
3. Click the **Add Task** button to save a new task.
4. Edit or delete tasks by clicking the respective buttons next to each task.
5. Tasks will persist across page reloads using **localStorage**.
